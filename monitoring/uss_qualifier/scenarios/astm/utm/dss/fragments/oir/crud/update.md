# Update operational intent reference test step fragment

This test step fragment validates that operational intent references can be updated.

## ðŸ›‘ Mutate operational intent reference query succeeds check

As per **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1](../../../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**, the DSS API must allow callers to mutate an operational intent reference.

## ðŸ›‘ Mutate operational intent reference response format conforms to spec check

The response to a successful operational intent reference mutation query is expected to conform to the format defined by the OpenAPI specification under the `A3.1` Annex of ASTM F3548âˆ’21.

If it does not, the DSS is failing to implement **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1](../../../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

## ðŸ›‘ Mutate operational intent reference response content is correct check

A successful operational intent reference mutation query is expected to return a well-defined body, the content of which reflects the updated operational intent reference.
If the content of the response does not correspond to what was requested, the DSS is failing to implement **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1](../../../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

This check will usually be performing a series of sub-checks from the [validate](../validate) fragments.
