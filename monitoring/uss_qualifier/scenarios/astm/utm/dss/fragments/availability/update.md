# USS Availability Read test step fragment

This fragment contains the steps for the USS Availability synchronization scenario
where we confirm that a USS availability can be correctly read from a DSS instance

## ðŸ›‘USS Availability can be updated check

If, when presented with a valid query to update the availability state of a USS, a DSS
responds with anything else than a 200 OK response, it is in violation of the OpenAPI spec referenced by DSS0005.

TODO unclear which requirement to point to: DSS0005,[1-5] do not cover this endpoint. DSS0210,A2-7-2,6 is about synchronization
