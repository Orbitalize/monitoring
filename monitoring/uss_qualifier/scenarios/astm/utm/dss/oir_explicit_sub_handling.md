# ASTM SCD DSS: Operational Intent Explicit Subscription handling test scenario

## Overview

Verifies the behavior of a DSS for interactions pertaining to operational intent references being attached to explicit subscriptions.

## Resources

### dss

[`DSSInstanceResource`](../../../../resources/astm/f3548/v21/dss.py) the DSS instance through which entities are created, modified and deleted.

### id_generator

[`IDGeneratorResource`](../../../../resources/interuss/id_generator.py) providing the base entity ID for this scenario.

### client_identity

[`ClientIdentityResource`](../../../../resources/communications/client_identity.py) the client identity that will be used to create and update operational intent references.

### planning_area

[`PlanningAreaResource`](../../../../resources/astm/f3548/v21/planning_area.py) describes the 3D volume in which operational intent references will be created.

## Setup test case

This test case ensures that no entities with the known test IDs exists in the DSS.

### [Cleanup OIRs test step](./clean_workspace_op_intents.md)

### [Cleanup Subscriptions test step](./clean_workspace_subs.md)

## Validate explicit subscription on OIR creation test case

Ensures that the explicit subscription provided upon creation of an OIR is properly validated and attached to the OIR.

### [Create independent subscription test step](./fragments/sub/crud/create_query.md)

### Provide subscription not covering extent of OIR being created test step

This step verifies that an OIR cannot be created when an explicit subscription that does not cover the extent of the OIR is specified.

#### ðŸ›‘ Request to create OIR with too short subscription fails check

If the DSS under test allows the qualifier to create an OIR with an explicit subscription that does not cover the extent of the OIR,
it is in violation of **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1](../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**

### Create an OIR with correct explicit subscription test step

When the provided subscription covers the extent of the OIR, the OIR can be created, and is then properly
attached to the specified subscription.

#### [OIR creation with a sufficient subscription is possible](./fragments/oir/crud/create_query.md)

### [OIR is attached to expected subscription test step](./fragments/oir/oir_has_expected_subscription.md)

## Validate explicit subscription upon subscription replacement test case

Ensures that when the explicit subscription tied to an OIR is replaced with another explicit subscription,
this subscription is properly validated and attached to the OIR.

### Create a subscription test step

Create an additional explicit subscription to be used in this test case.

#### [Create an additional explicit subscription](./fragments/sub/crud/create_query.md)

### Attempt to replace OIR's existing explicit subscription with an insufficient one test step

This step verifies that an OIR's existing explicit subscription cannot be replaced with an explicit subscription that does not cover the extent of the OIR.

#### ðŸ›‘ Request to mutate OIR while providing a too short subscription fails check

If the DSS under test allows the qualifier to replace an OIR's existing explicit subscription with an explicit subscription that does not cover the extent of the OIR,
it is in violation of **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1](../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**

#### [Unchanged OIR is attached to previous, valid, subscription](./fragments/oir/oir_has_expected_subscription.md)

### Replace the OIR's explicit subscription test step

This step verifies that an OIR attached to an explicit subscription can be mutated in order to be attached
to another explicit subscription that properly covers the extent of the OIR.

#### [Update the OIR's subscription](./fragments/oir/crud/update_query.md)

#### [Updated OIR is attached to newly specified subscription](./fragments/oir/oir_has_expected_subscription.md)

### [Cleanup OIR test step](./fragments/oir/crud/delete_query.md)

### [Cleanup subscription test step](./fragments/sub/crud/delete_query.md)

## Cleanup

### [Cleanup OIRs test step](./clean_workspace_op_intents.md)

### [Cleanup Subscriptions test step](./clean_workspace_subs.md)
